# Configuration Mangament System's week3's exercises
## First Steps - Creating new Repository and pushing the changes from local machine to remote repository in github

This weeks exercises were mostly about Git version control and Github, these exercises are made with markdown

1. Create the repository on my github profile
1. mkdir cms_week3 on my home folder on my local machine
1. Run the command: "git init" within the new folder
1. Create a new file with some text with the command "echo "Hello git" > README.md", this README.md file is a markdown file that is pushed on to github eventually
1. Run the command "git add README.md"
1. Run the command "git commit -m "first commit"" to commit the staged change, aka. the readme file in this case
1. Run the command "git remote add origin https://github.com/mjHarakka/configurationmanagementsystems_week3.git " to add the github repository as the origin for this local repository.
1. Run the command "git push -u origin master" to push the change to the origina (github repository)
